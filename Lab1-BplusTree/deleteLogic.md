# Delete Logic

Placing the entire pseudocode for the delete functions here not to clog the `.cpp` with comments. Check disclaimer at the bottom.

The general idea of this **bottom-up approach**, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrbaQDSuxIM), is to try things in the following order:
1. Borrow from left
2. Merge with left
3. Borrow from right
4. Merge with right

> **Note:** This implementation treats cousins as siblings.

```
DELETE(k):
  locate leaf n that contains k
  locate n->key[i] in n that contains k
  if not found:
    stop the procedure
  if found:
    erase n->key[i]
  if key[i] is not the last element:
    shift the remaining keys in n located to the right of key[i] one space to the left
  reduce number of n's keys by one
  if the number of keys condition isn't met by n:
    let node p be n->parent
    if the left sibling s exists:
      if it can borrow:
          have n borrow the maximum value key it needs from s
          update n's and s's number of keys
      if it can't:
          merge s and n by moving the remaining keys in n to s
          update s' number of keys
          update s->next as n->next
          delete n
          if n was not the rightmost child:
              shift the children located at its left to the left by 1
          reduce number of children in p by 1
    else if the right sibling s exists:
      if it can borrow:
          have n borrow the minimum value key it needs from s
          update n's and s's number of keys
      if it can't:
          merge s and n by moving the remaining keys in n to s
          delete n
          shift the rest of p's children to the left by 1
          reduce the number of children in s's father
    run internal deletion for p
```

Same logic applies to the internal delete, but using children instead of keys.

```
INTERNAL DELETE(p):
  if p is null:
    stop the procedure
  reset p's keys accordingly
  if p is the root and the root has one child:
    update the root as its child
    stop the procedure
  while the minimum children condition is not met by p:
    if the left sibling s exists:
        if it can borrow:
            borrow children from s
            update s's and p's keys
        if it can't:
            merge p onto s (by passing over the remaining children in p to the left of the already existing children in s)
            increase the number of children in s by the number of children passed over
            let temp be p
            set p as s
            delete temp
            update p's keys
    else if the right sibling s exists:
        if it can borrow:
            borrow children from s
            shift s's children to the left
            reset p's and s's keys accordingly
        if it can't:
            merge p onto s (by shifting s's children to the right and positioning the remaining children in p in the blank spaces)
            increase the number of children in s by the number of children passed over
            let temp be p
            set p as s
            delete temp
            update p's keys
    update p as p's father
    run internal deletion for p
```

> **Disclaimer:** yes, I have noticed the implementation results on a heap-buffer-overflow when ran with a sanitizer and that it overall has issues with freeing pointers. Yes, this algorithm is not perfect and its pseudocode is stupidly long, really. But here goes my sad attempt at getting this done, which has been enough to help me feel as if I have gotten a bit of the weight off my shoulders from the things I associate this structure with. I will still try to fix it whenever I get the chance. I want to make sure I actually make up with myself for everything that happened in December 2020. For now, however, fly high, B+ Tree ðŸ•Š
